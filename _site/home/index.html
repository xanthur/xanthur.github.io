                The dog in the locked cronked pot roast with no water, the dog is dying without water! Oh fuck that's good! That's fucking amazing! 
                Eat shit and die, I'm leaving! You think you're so smart? You think you know everything? Fuck off! Get out of this house right now! 
                Go to hell! Stop eating me! And stop drinking my blood, I'll kill you if you drink any more! Why did I ever trust you? What was wrong with me? 
                You had your chance and you fucked it up again! Get away from me! I hate you! I fucking hate you! You make me sick! 
                You made me do things I never would have done otherwise! Why can't you just leave me alone?! Please tell me why! Tell me what I did wrong! Anything! 
                Just tell me! Oh the dog died. The dog died because of you! You killed him! You killed him, you killed him, you killed him, he died because of you! 
                He was fine until you came home! You killed the poor little thing! He loved you! Why did you take him for granted like that? You always took him for granted! 
                You were so selfish! You didn't even care about him! So selfish! So cruel! I wish you'd never come back! You ruined everything!
