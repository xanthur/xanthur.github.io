            <p>
            the first 3D game i ever truly worked on is this game called the jremlin beast <br> 
            the creature in the picture is the jremlin beast image (which was a stupid photo of a friend i photoshopped years ago) <br>
            the plan is to put this model as a prop in every 3D game i make (usually hidden somewhere) <br>
            the model was heavily inspired by that one picture frame from half life 2 with the vance family in it
