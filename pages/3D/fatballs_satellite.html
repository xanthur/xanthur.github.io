            <h1>FATBALLS.WORLD SATELLITES</h1> 
            <br>
            <p>
                for context if you didn't read the xanthur.com earth page, i initially named this website fatballs.world <br>
                the original landing page had a few iterations, surrounding the idea of using a satellite (or satellites) for web navigation <br>
                i ended up scrapping it because it was just a little too jank, but it was super cool. 
            </p>
            <br>

            <h2>FIRST ITERATION</h2>
            <br>

            <br>
            <h3>INFO</h3>
            <p>
                this first version would slide off screen when you clicked the satellite that had the "click me" text<br>
                baked onto the texture, and the satellite would point towards the earth <br>
                (as if its reading signals from fatballs.world and sending them to you're browser)
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>(full view)</h3>

            <br>
            <h2>SECOND ITERATION</h2>
            <img src="/images/3D/fatballs satellites/multi_satellite.png" width="100%">
            <h3>INFO</h3>
            <p>
                the single slideable satellite was super jank, <br>
                so i ended up making a smaller satellite model and just spread them around the page. <br>
                honestly i think this looks way better, <br>
                but even then the website was slow to load because each one of those satellites was loading a video <br> 
                and it was just a super weird and annoying solution to work with.
            </p>
