                here's some of my backstory when it comes to making video.
                <br>
                <br>
                since i was a kid, i've had an aspiration of becoming a youtuber, and honestly i don't think i can lie and say that my aspiration was rooted in anything other than me watching some big youtuber
                at the time and thinking that it would be awesome to play video games as my job- i think exactly that experience is why you have the majority of kids nowadays saying they want to be a content creator.
                <br>
                <br>
                but right now i'm certainly struggling with making videos, i think this is because i don't really have an angle of what i actually WANT to make. this has caused me to go on a partial
                hiatus where i might upload a video on my main channel once every 6 months or so.
                <br>
                <br>
                most of my videos in the last year have been on my second channel mousebytes, where i make sort of shitposty/artsy videos. these videos have actually been very
                creatively fulfilling to make and i have some soulsearching to do as to why they're so fulfilling compared to my main.
