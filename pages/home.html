            <h1>welcome to my webbed site</h1>

            <p>
                welcome to my website, my name is xanthur and quite frequently i get a burning creative "itch" that i am inclined to scratch.
                <br>
                if i ever think an endeavour is remotely interesting i'll put it here on this website. 
                <br>
                maybe someday i'll write a better about section but i'm bad at writing about myself (great at talking about myself though... awkward)
                <br>
                <br>
                this website is still very bare bones; it's missing a lot of content and probably will need some reworks here and there but i'm working on it i pwomise..
