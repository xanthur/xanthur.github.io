            <br>
            the thing that got me into 3D art was, like many others, gamedev. I started when i was young screwing around with the hammer editor (which was where i learned to love level design/enviroment art, even though i suck at it)
            and now i'm finally starting to get the hang of blender.
            <br>
            the reason this page exists is because while most of my models are used for games i'm working on, a lot of those games might not ever see the light of day (gamedev is hard).
            <br>
            so i thought it was a good idea to show off some of the work i've done here on this page.
